Make the I Win Button with a 7x7x7 of Diamond Blocks with a Beacon in the center, place a Button on the center of any of the faces to WIN THE GAME!
This mod is perfectly survival friendly and fully balanced due to the need of a 7x7x7 MULTIBLOCK, the high resource usage and it needing a nether star.
